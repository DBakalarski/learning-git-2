	<h1>Numb</h1>	
	<h2>Linink Park</h2>
	<p>I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
		Feeling so faithless 
		Lost under the surface 
		I don't know what you're expecting of me 
		Put under the pressure 
		Of walking in your shoes
	</p>
	<p>
		[Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow] 
		Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
		[Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow] 

		I've become so numb 
		I can't feel you there 
		I've become so tired 
		So much more aware 
		I'm becoming this 
		All I want to do 
		Is be more like me 
		And be less like you
	</p>
